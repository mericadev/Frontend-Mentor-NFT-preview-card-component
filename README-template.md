## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Practiced how to use custom css variables for the first time and it made my styling process smooth.


```css
:root {
    --clr-dark-blue: hsl(217, 54%, 11%);
    --clr-very-dark-blue: hsl(216, 50%, 16%);
    --clr--line-dark-blue: hsl(215, 32%, 27%);
    --clr-white: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    --clr-primary:  hsl(215, 51%, 70%);
    --clr-cyan: hsl(178, 100%, 50%);
}
```

### Continued development

I aim to continue practicing my responsive design skills as well as use custom css variables more.
